# Abstract

This project investigates suicide death rates in the United States from 1999 to 2020, focusing on differences across sex, race, Hispanic origin, and age. Suicide is a leading cause of death with significant societal impacts, and certain groups face higher risks than others. By analyzing these disparities, we aim to uncover patterns in suicide rates across demographic groups and over time. Our findings will provide insights into gender vulnerabilities, racial and ethnic disparities, and temporal trends, contributing to the development of targeted prevention strategies.
